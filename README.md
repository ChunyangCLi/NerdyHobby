# NerdyHobby
This repo is my playground for personal nerdy hobbies.

There seems to be so many options in personal finance. I try to best quantify which is a better option. There are so many assumptions for each option. 
Having more knowledge of finance would help in this scenario.
Understanding how each option could possibly turn out to be by looking at the simulators could also potentially help improve the decision making.
